# **Assignment 4 â€“ KG with LLM**

## **Quality of DBpedia Ontology**

This project is developed as part of the course **Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models (KG with LLM)**. The assignment focuses on evaluating the **schema quality** of DBpedia through ambiguity detection and alignment with ESCO skills.

---

## **Overview**

The assignment is divided into two main tasks:

### **Task 1: Ambiguity Detection in DBpedia Schema (50%)**
- Develop a **term ambiguity detector** for class and property names in DBpedia.
- Use both:
  - **Dictionary-based approaches** (e.g., WordNet, Wiktionary)
  - **LLM-based approaches**
- Analyze and compare both methods in terms of **effectiveness** and **efficiency**.

### **Task 2: Modeling Abstract Skills Using ESCO (50%)**
- Map **ESCO skill entities** to DBpedia.
- Use LLMs to **evaluate the correctness** of class-entity mappings.
- Analyze where DBpedia fails or succeeds in modeling abstract concepts.

## **Instructions**

1. Open `assignment_4_kg_llm.ipynb` in Colab or Jupyter.
2. Follow instructions in each task cell to install dependencies and execute workflows.
3. Explore `task1/` and `task2/endpoint/` folders for sample inputs and generated results.
4. Review `FINAL_DF.csv` for ESCOâ€“DBpedia alignment and LLM evaluation output.
