# Knowledge Graphs with LLM – Assignments

This repository contains all four assignments completed in the scope of the course **Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models (KG with LLM)** at **Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)**. Each assignment explores how LLMs can enhance different stages of the knowledge graph lifecycle — from schema design to population, querying, and ontology quality evaluation.
